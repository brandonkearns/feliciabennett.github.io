						<p>This was her first ever tour and role as a full time manager. This was a 3 week, 15 date tour that took her to all 3 coasts. Deante Hitchcock is a prolific Atlanta rapper that Rapsody invited to be one of  her opening acts. Starting November 29th, Felicia drove Deante’s band and crew to NYC for the first east coast show of tour at S.O.B.’s. It was sold out with a line out the door. Fans were craning their necks hoping to catch a glimpse of the Deante, Rapsody, and Ninth Wonder before the show. This winter tour was 90% sold out before the tour even started. The art of lyricism and real hip-hop was showcased on this tour. Felicia managed to successfully get Deante’s team to all venues and ended every night with a great show and new fans. Laila’s Wisdom and So Much For Good Luck are albums you need to put your ears on.</p>
